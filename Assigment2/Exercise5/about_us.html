                    <p>Hey there! My full name is Olga-Maria Kavourinou and I am a programmer based in Athens, Greece.
                        I was born and raised in Greece and graduated from school in 2019. I am currently majoring in computer science at the Athens University of Economics and Business.
                        I'm passionate about front-end development because it lets me express my creativity while focusing on creating enjoyable and user-friendly experiences. 
                        I love crafting designs that not only look great but also feel effortless for users to navigate. Once I finish college I am looking forward to start my career as a web developer.
